/**
 * xLinker (read as: "Cross-Linker")
 *
 * Sometimes it's useful to cross link a click so when you (for example:) click 
 * "New" on something it's also interpreted as clicking cancel on other box'es 
 * you had opened. You could do this by hand... and waste your life, or you 
 * could xlink (lt. "cross-link") them togheter. :)
 *
 * The xlinks will only trigger if they are not in the current scope. For in
 * scope magic see the ui plugin. The purpose of the xlink plugin is to trigger
 * the right click events BLIND. This is why they trigger out of scope; scope 
 * being that which you know and control, or more often "that which you care
 * to think about at that moment".
